wget -r –level=0 -E –ignore-length -x -k -p -erobots=off -np -N http://www.remote.com/remote/presentation/dir

Here are the options:

-r : Recursive retrieving (important)
–level=0: Specify recursion maximum depth level (0 for no limit), very important
-E: append “.html” extension to every document declared as “application/html“
useful when you deal with dirs (that are not dirs but index.html files)
–ignore-lenght: Ignore “Content-length” http headers, sometimes useful when dealing with bugged CGI programs
-x: Force dirs, create an hierarchy of directories even if one would not been created otherwise
-k: here’s one of the most useful options, it converts remote links to local for best viewing
-p: download ll the files that are necessary for proper display of the page
(not so reliable when dealing with JS code but useful)
-erobots=off: turn off http robots.txt usage
-np: no parent, do not ascend to parent dir when retrieving recursively,
one of the most useful function I’ve seen
